Quarto is an open-source system specialized in technical and scientific publishing. With Quarto you can write your articles as Jupyter notebooks and then publish them as a website, pdf and/or docx documents.\n\nThe nice thing is that you can easily mix text, code, and the result of computations. Let's see an example.\n\n### Example: Polar Axis\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![A line plot on a polar axis](index_files/figure-html/fig-polar-output-1.png){#fig-polar width=450 height=439}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here is a screen shot of my IDE editing the source of this post.\n\n![](vscode_screenshot.png)\n\n",
